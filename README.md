# Java 2D Game Project
## Project Overview
This project is a 2D, 16-bit style exploration game built in Java. The main objective is to roam a pixel-art map inspired by a real-world location (e.g., a section of a university campus). Players can navigate the environment, interact with objects, and encounter simple NPCs.

### Features
Tile-Based Map & Rendering: Utilize a grid-based layout for level design and tile rendering.
Collision Detection: Ensure realistic player movement with bounding box checks.
Basic AI & Pathfinding: Implement an A*-like algorithm (or BFS/DFS) for NPC movement and obstacle avoidance.
Sprite Animations & Camera: Animate characters and smoothly scroll the camera around the environment.
Audio Integration: Include sound effects or background music to enhance immersion.
### Technologies & Tools
Java 8+ (or Java 17, depending on your environment)
LibGDX or Java2D / Java Swing for 2D rendering (depending on your specific approach)
Tiled or a custom map editor for level design (optional)
JUnit for unit testing collision/pathfinding logic
